# Automation and Installation Scripts

## About the Project

You know those tasks you always end up doing manually, even after automating other parts of your workflow? Installing Moodle was one of those for me. I took the opportunity to finally create an automated installer! The idea is to expand this repository with more features, like installing plugins automatically (by passing an array of plugins and versions, for example) and other useful automations.

This repository is open for anyone who wants to collaborate, suggest improvements, report bugs, or add new features. If you have an idea to make these scripts more efficient, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. Let's learn together and make automation even more powerful!

Besides making repetitive tasks easier, this project is a great opportunity to explore and learn more about shell scripts and how useful they can be in daily tasks.
